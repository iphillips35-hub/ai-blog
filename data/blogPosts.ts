# Getting Started with LangChain

LangChain is a powerful framework for developing applications powered by language models. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through building your first AI application.

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.

## Key Features

- **Modular Components**: Build complex applications from simple, reusable components
- **Chain Management**: Easily create sequences of calls to LLMs and other tools
- **Memory Systems**: Maintain context across multiple interactions
- **Agent Framework**: Build autonomous agents that can use tools and make decisions

## Building Your First Application

Let's create a simple question-answering application:

\`\`\`python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Initialize the LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)

# Create a prompt template
template = "Answer the following question: {question}"
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])

# Create a chain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run the chain
response = chain.run("What is artificial intelligence?")
print(response)
\`\`\`

## Advanced Patterns

Once you've mastered the basics, you can explore:

- **Document Loading**: Process and query large documents
- **Vector Stores**: Implement semantic search capabilities
- **Agents**: Create autonomous AI assistants
- **Custom Chains**: Build specialized workflows for your use case

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic chains before moving to complex agents
2. **Test Thoroughly**: LLM outputs can be unpredictable, so test extensively
3. **Monitor Costs**: Keep track of API usage to manage expenses
4. **Handle Errors**: Implement robust error handling for production applications

# Building a Production-Ready Chatbot with OpenAI API

Creating a chatbot is easy. Building one that's production-ready is a different challenge. Let's explore how to do it right.

## Architecture Overview

A production chatbot needs:
- Robust error handling
- Rate limiting
- Conversation memory
- User authentication
- Analytics and monitoring

## Setting Up the Foundation

\`\`\`typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

async function chat(message: string, conversationHistory: any[]) {
  try {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4",
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        ...conversationHistory,
        { role: "user", content: message }
      ],
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 500,
    });
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Implementing Conversation Memory

Store conversation history to maintain context:

\`\`\`typescript
class ConversationManager {
  private conversations = new Map();
  
  addMessage(userId: string, role: string, content: string) {
    if (!this.conversations.has(userId)) {
      this.conversations.set(userId, []);
    }
    
    const history = this.conversations.get(userId);
    history.push({ role, content });
    
    // Keep only last 10 messages to manage token usage
    if (history.length > 10) {
      history.shift();
    }
  }
  
  getHistory(userId: string) {
    return this.conversations.get(userId) || [];
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Rate Limiting

Protect your API budget with rate limiting:

\`\`\`typescript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/api/chat', limiter);
\`\`\`

## Error Handling

Implement comprehensive error handling:

\`\`\`typescript
async function safeChat(message: string, userId: string) {
  try {
    const history = conversationManager.getHistory(userId);
    const response = await chat(message, history);
    
    conversationManager.addMessage(userId, 'user', message);
    conversationManager.addMessage(userId, 'assistant', response);
    
    return { success: true, response };
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 429) {
      return { success: false, error: 'Rate limit exceeded' };
    }
    return { success: false, error: 'An error occurred' };
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Deployment Considerations

- Use environment variables for API keys
- Implement logging and monitoring
- Set up alerts for errors and high usage
- Consider using a queue for handling requests
- Implement graceful degradation

## Conclusion

Building a production-ready chatbot requires attention to detail, but the result is a robust application that can scale with your users.

# The Complete Guide to Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the skill of crafting inputs that get the best outputs from AI models. Let's master it.

## Core Principles

### 1. Be Specific
Vague prompts get vague results. Be clear about what you want.

**Bad**: "Write about AI"
**Good**: "Write a 500-word introduction to machine learning for beginners, focusing on practical applications"

### 2. Provide Context
Give the model information it needs to understand your request.

### 3. Use Examples
Show the model what you want with examples (few-shot learning).

### 4. Iterate
Refine your prompts based on results.

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain of Thought
Ask the model to explain its reasoning:
"Let's think step by step..."

### Role Playing
Assign the model a role:
"You are an expert Python developer..."

### Output Formatting
Specify the desired format:
"Provide your answer as a JSON object with keys..."

## Common Patterns

1. **Instruction Following**: Clear, direct commands
2. **Question Answering**: Structured questions with context
3. **Text Transformation**: Specify input and desired output format
4. **Creative Generation**: Provide style, tone, and constraints

## Tools and Resources

- OpenAI Playground
- PromptBase
- LangChain prompt templates

## Conclusion

Prompt engineering is a skill that improves with practice. Experiment, iterate, and learn from results!
